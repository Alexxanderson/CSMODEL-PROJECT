    "\n",
    "#### In connection with the EDA's...\n",
    "Based on our exploratory data analysis, it is evident that determining the success of a YouTube channel is a wide ranging task; it is not solely reliant on one variable. Our findings reveal that a channel can excel in certain metrics while falling short in others. A noteworthy case in point is the earnings of successful YouTube channels, where some channels with high view and subscriber counts may generate minimal or no revenue due to certain reasons, and conversely, some less prominent channels might generate substantial earnings. with that said, there are some metrics that do have some sort of correlation with each other. The positive correlation between subscriber count and view count for a YouTube channel means that having a higher subscriber count means having a higher view count. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data analysis suggests that there are potential factors that have a positive correlation with the metrics that determine the success of a YouTube channel. These factors include a channel’s category of content and country origin. However, further study is needed to specifically find the correlation of a potential factor to each given metric of success.\n",

    "#### Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyzing the observations from our exploratory data analysis, we have observed that there are existing key factors that explains the high values in some the YouTube Metrics\n",
    "- A YouTube Channel’s success can be derived from these existing factors which explains why a given YouTube Channel’s Analytics considers metrics such as impressions, click-through, likes, shares, view count, subscriber, and the list goes on. Youtube Channel Analytics is a bird’s eye view to monitor its channel vitals, like real-time views, total views, watch time, subscribers, etc. It is perfect for getting a performance overview over a period at a quick glance.\n",
    "- In consideration of YouTube's Algorithm, it also looks at the demography of viewer's video relevance and category and recommends it to similar audiences. \n",
    "- In addition, considering a success metric that will determine “success” for a youtube video, this would include subscribers, video views, earnings, rankings(overall and country). We test out other parameters in the dataset that we can consider “factors”, this could be country, population count of the country, category and category rank, education attainment, urban population, employment rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Significance of the Study\n",
    "\n",
    "    In determining the factors that enhances a YouTube Channel’s success, it carries substantial importance on various fronts. It provides practical guidance for content creators, empowering them to make data-driven choices about their content and strategies. This research has broader industry implications as it aids businesses in optimizing their marketing endeavors on the YouTube platform. Moreover, unraveling these success factors contributes to the academic understanding of digital media, informs evidence-based decision-making, and can potentially influence policies and regulations pertaining to online content. This study could extend its impact to a wider spectrum, offering insights into the dynamics of content creation and user engagement in the digital realm, making it a multidimensional and highly pertinent field of inquiry.\n",

    "A z-score threshold of 3 standard deviations from the mean was employed during outlier detection and removal in the data preprocessing phase. This specific threshold was chosen for several reasons:\n",
    " - A threshold of 3 standard deviations helps ensure that only data points significantly deviating from the mean are flagged as outliers.\n",
    " - It allows for the removal of extreme values while retaining a sufficient amount of data for a meaningful analysis.\n",
    " - By removing outliers using a z-score threshold of 3, the subsequent normalization process is less likely to be skewed by these extreme values, leading to a more accurate representation of the data distribution.\n",

A YouTube channel's creation date significantly influences its total number of video views, with the age of the channel serving as an indicator of its establishment within the platform. This aspect may impact visibility, reputation, and viewer engagement over time. In uncovering whether older channels tend to have higher video views or if newer channels can also achieve significant viewership, understanding this potential association provides insights into the impact of a channel's longevity on its overall video viewership.\n",

    "   Based on the results and findings of the T-test statistic investigating the association between a Youtuber's video views and the YouTube Channel's creation date, the t-test statistic yielded a value of **`-17.0253`**.

    "Description: In this analysis phase, the team investigates the potential relationship between a Youtuber's total number of video views and the channel's average yearly earnings. The primary goal is to determine whether the financial success of a channel, represented by its average yearly earnings, has a statistically significant association with the overall count of video views. The hypothesis suggests that a Youtuber's video views may be significantly linked to the average yearly earnings of their channel, with financial success serving as an indicator of popularity, content quality, and audience engagement. By examining the association between video views and average yearly earnings, the analysis seeks to unveil whether channels with higher video views tend to generate greater financial returns. This exploration provides valuable insights into the financial dynamics of a channel's success and its correlation with video viewership.\n",
